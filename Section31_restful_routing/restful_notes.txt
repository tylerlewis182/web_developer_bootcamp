RESTful Routing

REST - (REpresentational State Transfer). It is a mapping between
       HTTP routes and CRUD (Create Read Update and Destroy)


Example:

NAME    |   PATH      |  HTTP Verb  |   PURPOSE
-----------------------------------------------------
Index     /dogs          GET           List all dogs
New       /dogs/new      GET           Show new dog form.
Create    /dogs          POST          Create a new dog, then redirect somewhere.
Show      /dogs/:id      GET           Show info about one specific dog.
Edit      /dogs/:id/edit GET           Show edit form for one dog.
Update    /dogs/:id      PUT           Update a particular dog, then redirect somewhere.
Destroy   /dogs/:id      DELETE        Delete a particular dog, then redirect somewhere.
